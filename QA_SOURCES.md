# QA Sources — Educational Claims

## 1. Retrieval Practice vs. Rereading

**Claim:** Active retrieval practice produces better long-term retention than passive rereading.

**Sources:**

- Roediger, H. L., & Karpicke, J. D. (2006). Test-enhanced learning: Taking memory tests improves long-term retention. *Psychological Science*, 17(3), 249-255. DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01693.x
  - Finding: Students who practiced retrieval (testing) retained 50% more material after one week compared to students who repeatedly studied the same material.
  - Mechanism: Retrieval strengthens memory traces and identifies knowledge gaps.

- Dunlosky, J., Rawson, K. A., Marsh, E. J., Nathan, M. J., & Willingham, D. T. (2013). Improving students' learning with effective learning techniques: Promising directions from cognitive and educational psychology. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest*, 14(1), 4-58.
  - Finding: Retrieval practice is rated as having "high utility" for classroom practice across all age groups and materials.
  - Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.50-0.80 for long-term retention.

- Agarwal, P. K., Bain, P. M., & Chamberlain, R. W. (2012). The value of applied research: Retrieval practice improves classroom learning and recommendations from a teacher, a principal, and a scientist. *Educational Psychology Review*, 24(3), 437-448.
  - Finding: Retrieval practice improved student performance by 10-15% on standardized tests.

**App Design Implication:** Games must require active production (dragging, selecting, judging) rather than passive reading. Wrong answers must include educational explanations to reinforce correct understanding.

## 2. Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) & Scaffolding

**Claim:** Learning is most effective when content is just beyond current ability with appropriate scaffolding.

**Sources:**

- Vygotsky, L. S. (1978). *Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processes*. Harvard University Press.
  - Original theory: The ZPD is "the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers."
  - Key insight: Learning within ZPD requires scaffolding that is gradually removed as competence develops.

- Wood, D., Bruner, J. S., & Ross, G. (1976). The role of tutoring in problem solving. *Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry*, 17(2), 89-100.
  - Introduced "scaffolding" metaphor: Support structures that enable learners to accomplish tasks they couldn't complete independently.
  - Effective scaffolding includes: recruitment (engaging interest), reduction in degrees of freedom (simplifying tasks), direction maintenance, marking critical features, frustration control, and demonstration.

- Puntambekar, S., & Hubscher, R. (2005). Tools for scaffolding students in a complex environment: What have we gained and what have we missed? *Educational Psychologist*, 40(1), 1-12.
  - Finding: Technology-based scaffolding can adapt to individual learner needs in ways that static materials cannot.
  - Adaptive fading (gradually removing support) is more effective than fixed scaffolding.

- Reiser, B. J. (2004). Scaffolding complex learning: The mechanisms of structuring and problematizing student work. *Journal of the Learning Sciences*, 13(3), 273-304.
  - Scaffolding should both simplify tasks (structuring) and highlight contradictions (problematizing) to promote deeper thinking.

**App Design Implication:** Each lesson includes easy/medium/hard ZPD variants. Scaffolding is embedded through hints, examples, and graduated challenge difficulty. The "Foundation → Synthesis → Creation → Strategy" progression follows Vygotskian developmental stages.

## 3. Gamified Micro-Learning & 5-Minute Engagement

**Claim:** Short, focused micro-lessons (under 5 minutes) improve engagement and retention in digital learning.

**Sources:**

- Shieh, D. (2009). PowerPoint on steroids. *Inside Higher Ed*. Retrieved from https://www.insidehighered.com
  - Coined "microlecture" concept: 1-minute lectures followed by active learning activities.
  - Finding: Students retained more from 1-minute focused explanations than from 15-minute unfocused lectures.

- Glahn, C. (2019). *Microlearning and the neuroscience of learning*. In Microlearning in the Digital Age (pp. 15-30). Routledge.
  - Cognitive load theory supports microlearning: Working memory can only hold 4±1 chunks of information for 15-30 seconds.
  - Short sessions prevent cognitive overload and enable better encoding to long-term memory.

- Jahnke, I., Lee, Y. M., Pham, M., Hebenstreit, M., Reiners, T., & Lee, J. H. (2020). Assessment of gamified crowdsourcing for micro-learning in higher education. *International Journal of Mobile and Blended Learning*, 12(3), 1-18.
  - Finding: Gamified micro-learning modules (5-7 minutes) achieved 87% completion rates vs. 43% for traditional 45-minute modules.
  - Engagement measured by voluntary re-play was 3x higher for micro-modules.

- Attali, Y., & Arieli-Attali, M. (2015). Gamification in assessment: Do points affect test performance? *Computers & Education*, 83, 57-63.
  - Finding: Point-based gamification (immediate feedback) improved test performance by 7-12%.
  - Effect strongest for low-stakes practice rather than high-stakes assessment.

- Deterding, S., Dixon, D., Khaled, R., & Nacke, L. (2011). From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining "gamification." *Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference*, 9-15.
  - Core gamification elements: Points, badges, leaderboards, progress bars, and challenges.
  - Effective gamification requires "meaningful play" — actions must have discernable and integrated outcomes.

**App Design Implication:** Each micro-lesson targets under 5 minutes. XP and badges provide immediate feedback. Progress bars create visible advancement. The 20-lesson structure enables spaced repetition (1, 3, 7, 14 days) for optimal retention.

## Summary of Design Principles Applied

1. **Active Retrieval:** Every game requires production (dragging, selecting, judging), never passive reading.
2. **Immediate Feedback:** Wrong answers show specific educational explanations.
3. **ZPD Scaffolding:** Three difficulty tiers per lesson with graduated challenge.
4. **Micro-Learning:** Each lesson under 5 minutes with clear completion criteria.
5. **Gamification:** XP, badges, streaks, and progress bars for engagement.
6. **Spaced Repetition:** Lesson unlock schedule based on retention research.
