**Key Skills:**
- Explain Complex Concepts
- Summarize Texts
- Research & Verification
- Fact-Checking

### 2. Creativity & Content (Generative Mode)
Covers AI's role in generating novel ideas, art, and content.

**Key Skills:**
- Brainstorm Ideas
- Draft Content
- Transform Content
- Edit & Refine

### 3. Analysis & Problem Solving (Analytical Mode)
Involves AI's capacity to analyze complex problems and optimize solutions.

**Key Skills:**
- Compare Options
- Evaluate Risk
- Decompose Problems
- Build Workflows

## Skill Ladder (Dreyfus Model)

### Novice 🌱
- Follows rules without context
- Copy/paste prompts, one-step tasks
- **Next:** Add verification + SPEC prompting

### Competent ⚔️
- Understands context, applies rules flexibly
- Iterates, adds constraints, compares sources
- **Next:** Add evaluation rubric + bias checks

### Proficient 👑
- Intuitively grasps patterns, adapts strategies
- Chooses right capability stack, builds guardrails
- **Next:** Metacognition + strategy + test harness
